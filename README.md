# Kunoichi

## Who

Developed by me, Andrew Dunham.

## What

A simple frontend to help generate [ninja](http://martine.github.com/ninja/) build files.

## Where

On GitHub at [http://github.com/andrew-d/kunoichi]()

## Why

Mainly, lack of wildcards.  Also, other build systems make handling multiple steps painful.  I'm trying to keep this simple and yet powerful.

## How

Check out example.py, or read the code.  It's under 200 lines long.
